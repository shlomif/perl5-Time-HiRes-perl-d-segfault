=head1 ABOUT

This is some Perl code that reproduces a segfault in a custom perl debugger
(-d:KP) caused by loading Time::HiRes . In order to run it,
go over the source files (to make sure they do not contain anything nasty),
and then type "make test".

=head1 LICENSE

As far as Shlomi Fish is concerned, the license is multi-licensed as
MIT/X11/Public Domain/CC-Zero/Artistic 2.0/Same-terms-as-Perl/License-of-your-choice
but the original code originated from “KES”.
